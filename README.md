# Travel Booking System

This is a Django-based travel booking system that allows users to filter and book various travel options.

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/travel-booking.git cd travel-booking
```


2. Create a virtual environment:

```bash
python -m venv venv
```


3. Activate the virtual environment:
- On Windows:
  ```
  venv\Scripts\activate
  ```
- On macOS and Linux:
  ```
  source venv/bin/activate
  ```

4. Install the required packages:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```


5. Set up the database:
```bash
python manage.py migrate
```

6. Create a superuser:
```bash
python manage.py createsuperuser
```


7. Run the development server:
```bash
python manage.py runserver
```


8. Access the application at `http://localhost:8000`

## Troubleshooting

- If you encounter any package installation issues, make sure your pip is up to date:
```bash
pip install --upgrade pip
```


- If you get a "No module named 'django'" error, ensure you've activated your virtual environment and installed the requirements.

- For database-related issues, try:
```bash
python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate
```


- If you're having trouble with static files, run:
```bash
python manage.py collectstatic
```


- For any other issues, please check the Django documentation or open an issue in this repository.
